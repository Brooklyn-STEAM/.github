Welcome to the Brooklyn STEAM Center's GitHub organization! We are a cutting-edge Career & Technical Education center located within the historic Brooklyn Navy Yard. Through our strategic partnership with the Yard and its diverse business community, we directly connect our scholars to industry while empowering the next generation of technology and manufacturing leaders through innovative, industry-informed experiences.

We deliver hands-on, workplace-based learning that bridges the gap between education and industry. Our unique approach transforms the traditional classroom into a real-world workspace, creating a diverse and skilled talent pipeline while empowering students to shape their own futures.
